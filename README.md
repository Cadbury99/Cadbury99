### Hi there 👋

🌱 I’m currently learning how to code HTML and CSS. JS is next on deck but apparantly learning GitHub has moved up the chain in priorities.

🤔 I’m looking for help with understanding how to work GitHub.

⚡ Fun fact: I am currently working as a jeweler. I have discovered after 18 years in the business that it's not enough to keep my brain occupied any longer.
